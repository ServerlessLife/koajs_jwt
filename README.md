# koajs_jwt

Sample Node.js app written in TypeScript, using Koa.js, JWT authentication and Jest tests.

Further improvements:
- I really like dependency injection. For example with [Inversify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inversify).
- I choose integration test with Jest that test server, data access logic and DB. Unit test with mocking would also be great especially if there is more complex logic.
- There is no logging.
